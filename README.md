 Series of non-sensical SQL queries on worldwide GDP data

This challenge was recommended on DataLemur.com, where I have been doing some SQL practice problems. It appears to be from a SQL take-home project that someone received as part of a job interview. It definitely helped me practice my SQL skills someone. In particular, I was able to practice CTEs on "real-world" problems.
